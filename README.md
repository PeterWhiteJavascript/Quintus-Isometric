# Quintus-Isometric
Isometric Support for Quintus
As always, make sure to run this demo on localhost.
I mostly followed this tutorial: http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-isometric-worlds-a-primer-for-game-developers--gamedev-6511

TODO:
* Add auto detection for if an isometric tile map is loaded in. Right now you have to add a Class:IsoTileLayer to the tile layer in Tiled.
* Add proper depth sorting
* Create a map editor that allows you to place tiles stacked on top of other tiles so there are different heights of squares.
* Use Quintus's original tile rendering method since it is more efficient.
